# üß† Modular Data Science Project Template (with GitHub Pages Support)

A clean, reproducible, and presentation-ready structure for data science projects. Designed for those who want to work like a software engineer **and** tell a compelling data story.

Whether you're doing exploratory analysis, machine learning, or full end-to-end pipelines, this template keeps your work organized and publishable‚Äîcomplete with GitHub Pages support using Markdown or Jekyll.

---

## ‚úÖ Goals

This template helps you:

* **Modularize your workflow** ‚Äî from data fetching ‚Üí cleaning ‚Üí modeling ‚Üí visualization.
* **Promote reproducibility** ‚Äî through versioned code, data stages, and environment files.
* **Publish results** ‚Äî via built-in support for GitHub Pages.
* **Adapt easily** ‚Äî for simple EDA projects or complex ML pipelines.

---

## üß∞ Project Essentials

The following files form the backbone of your project setup:

* **`README.md`**: You're reading it ‚Äî the complete guide to the structure and purpose of this template.
* **`environment.yml`** *(or `requirements.txt`)*: Defines your Python environment to ensure others can reproduce your setup.
* **`Makefile`** *(or `run.py`)*: Optional automation tool to run pipeline steps (e.g., fetch, clean, model) with one command.
* **`.gitignore`**: Keeps clutter out of version control ‚Äî especially data, environments, and Jupyter artifacts.

---

## üìÇ Core Folders and Their Purpose

Organized for clarity, reusability, and GitHub Pages compatibility:

### `data/` ‚Äî Versioned Datasets by Stage

* `raw/`: Original source data ‚Äî never modified.
* `interim/`: Partially cleaned data used for QA or intermediate steps.
* `processed/`: Final datasets used for modeling or reporting.
* `external/`: Third-party reference data or shared public sources.

### `database/` ‚Äî (Optional)

* SQLite, DuckDB, or connection configs for external databases.

### `notebooks/` ‚Äî Linear Project Progression

Step-by-step documentation and execution of your workflow:

* `01_fetch.ipynb`: Collecting or importing data.
* `02_clean.ipynb`: Cleaning, transforming, and validating data.
* `03_eda.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis and insights.
* `04_modeling.ipynb`: Model training, tuning, and evaluation.
* `05_viz.ipynb`: Final charts or interactive visualizations.

### `src/` ‚Äî Modular, Reusable Python Code

Each subfolder handles a key part of the data pipeline:

* `fetch/`: Scripts to download or scrape data.
* `prep/`: Data cleaning, normalization, and validation logic.
* `features/`: Feature engineering scripts for ML models.
* `eda/`: EDA helpers like summary stats, plotting functions.
* `models/`: Model training, evaluation, and serialization.
* `viz/`: Plotting or dashboard generation code.
* `utils/`: Logging, config loading, or reusable helpers.

### `reports/` ‚Äî Deliverables and Visual Content

* `figures/`: Static charts, tables, or image exports.
* `dashboards/`: Streamlit or Plotly dashboards exported as HTML.
* `summary.md`: Final summary write-up, ready to be rendered in your GitHub Pages site.

---

## üåê GitHub Pages Integration (Optional)

You can publish your project as a static website with minimal effort:

### Key Files for Pages:

* **`index.md`**: Markdown homepage ‚Äî GitHub Pages renders this automatically.
* **`index.html`** *(optional)*: Use if you want full control with custom HTML, D3.js, or Observable embeds.
* **`_config.yml`** *(optional)*: Configure your Jekyll site ‚Äî set the title, theme, markdown options.
* **`assets/`**: Static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) for your site or embedded reports.

### Example Markdown Image:

```markdown
![ROC Curve](/reports/figures/roc_curve.png)
```

## üîÑ Recommended Workflow

Each step corresponds to a notebook and source code folder:

1. **Fetch data**

   * Code: `src/fetch/`
   * Notebook: `notebooks/01_fetch.ipynb`
   * Output: `data/raw/`

2. **Clean and transform**

   * Code: `src/prep/`, `src/features/`
   * Notebooks: `02_clean.ipynb`, `03_eda.ipynb`
   * Output: `data/interim/`, `data/processed/`

3. **Explore and visualize**

   * Code: `src/eda/`, `src/viz/`
   * Notebooks: `03_eda.ipynb`, `05_viz.ipynb`
   * Output: `reports/figures/`

4. **Model**

   * Code: `src/models/`
   * Notebook: `04_modeling.ipynb`
   * Output: `data/processed/`, optionally `models/`

5. **Publish**

   * Summarize findings in `reports/summary.md`
   * Add visuals and narrative to `index.md`
   * Push to GitHub ‚Äî Pages does the rest.

## üõ†Ô∏è Automation Example

If you‚Äôre using a Makefile:

```make
fetch:
	python src/fetch/fetch_data.py

clean:
	python src/prep/clean_data.py

model:
	python src/models/train_model.py

all: fetch clean model
```

Or create a `run.py` with `argparse` for a Python CLI.

---

## üí° Tips

* Use `nbconvert` to export notebooks as `.html` or `.md` for embedding in GitHub Pages.
* Exclude large files and development clutter in `.gitignore` (`.env`, `.ipynb_checkpoints/`, etc.).
* Want to go further? Add `pyproject.toml`, `tests/`, or GitHub Actions for CI.
