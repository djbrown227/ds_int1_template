🧠 Modular Data Science Project Template (with GitHub Pages Support)

This is a clean, reproducible, and web-presentable template for your data science projects. It’s designed to help you work like a software engineer and a storyteller: build pipelines, separate concerns, and publish your results directly to the web using GitHub Pages (with optional Jekyll support).

✅ Goals

This template helps you:

Modularize your workflow: From data fetching → cleaning → modeling → visualization.
Promote reproducibility: Keep code and data traceable and versioned.
Present your results: Share charts, dashboards, and project summaries online.
Stay flexible: Handle EDA-only, ML-only, or full end-to-end projects.
🧱 What's Included

This project includes the following components:

🔧 Project Essentials
README.md: You’re reading it — a full guide to this template, purpose, and usage.
environment.yml: Conda environment definition for reproducibility (can use requirements.txt instead).
Makefile or run.py: Automate tasks like fetching, cleaning, training, and visualization.
📂 Core Folders and Their Purpose
data/: All your datasets live here — cleanly separated by processing stage:
raw/: Original, untouched files (do not modify).
interim/: Cleaned but not yet finalized (e.g., for QA or partial pipelines).
processed/: Final datasets ready for modeling or visualization.
notebooks/: Ordered Jupyter notebooks covering each step:
01_fetch.ipynb: Data collection (from APIs, scraping, or loading).
02_clean.ipynb: Data cleaning, wrangling, and transformation.
03_eda.ipynb: Exploratory data analysis and summary stats.
04_modeling.ipynb: Model training, evaluation, and tuning.
05_viz.ipynb: Static or interactive visualizations.
src/: Your modular code — reusable and maintainable:
fetch/: Scripts to retrieve data (e.g., API clients, web scrapers).
prep/: Data cleaning, validation, normalization.
features/: Feature engineering for modeling.
eda/: Helpers for EDA (e.g., summary tables, correlation plots).
models/: ML model training and evaluation logic.
viz/: Code to generate plots, charts, or visual components.
reports/: Presentation-ready outputs:
figures/: Saved plots, images, and visual outputs.
dashboards/: HTML dashboards (e.g., Streamlit or Plotly exports).
summary.md: Markdown summary to embed in GitHub Pages.
database/ (optional): SQLite or DuckDB files, or configs for external databases.
🌐 GitHub Pages + Jekyll Integration
You can turn your project into a website with GitHub Pages. These files enable that:

index.md: Homepage written in Markdown. GitHub Pages converts this into your site’s landing page.
index.html (optional): Use this if you prefer a fully custom HTML homepage (for D3.js, Observable, etc).
_config.yml (optional): Jekyll site config — sets title, theme, and markdown parser.
assets/: Static web content — CSS, JavaScript, and images for use in your homepage or reports.
Use images like this in your markdown:

🔄 Recommended Workflow

Each step corresponds to a folder and a notebook for reproducibility:

Fetch data
Code in: src/fetch/
Notebook: notebooks/01_fetch.ipynb
Output to: data/raw/
Clean and transform
Code in: src/prep/, src/features/
Notebooks: 02_clean.ipynb, 03_eda.ipynb
Output to: data/interim/ and data/processed/
EDA and Visualization
Code in: src/eda/, src/viz/
Notebooks: 03_eda.ipynb, 05_viz.ipynb
Output to: reports/figures/
Modeling
Code in: src/models/
Notebook: 04_modeling.ipynb
Save artifacts to: data/processed/ or a models/ folder if added
Publish
Add key visuals and text to reports/summary.md
Reference them in index.md
Commit and push → GitHub Pages handles the rest!
🛠️ Automation Example

Use the Makefile to run steps with simple commands:

fetch:
	python src/fetch/fetch_api.py

clean:
	python src/prep/clean_data.py

model:
	python src/models/train_model.py

all: fetch clean model
Or use run.py with argparse for a more robust CLI entry point.

💡 Tips

Use nbconvert to turn notebooks into .md or .html for embedding in your GitHub Pages site.
Keep .gitignore clean by excluding .ipynb_checkpoints/, .env, large raw datasets, and temporary files.
For long-term or collaborative projects, consider adding tests/, a pyproject.toml, and GitHub Actions CI.
